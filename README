Tigress Pub Theme

This is a custom, responsive Wordpress theme for a popular Austin pub. The owner specified that she wanted a single page site, and the simplest admin possible. I used the Multiple Content Blocks Plugin to ensure that she could upload photos to the sidebar easily, and Fancybox to create a one-click gallery.
